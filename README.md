# Monarch Butterfly



## Description

The Monarch Butterfly is a passion project built for educational and inspiration purposes. The Law of Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions, also known as The Butterfly Effect is largely misconstrued as something relevant solely to the past. The present is equally if not more so relevant as everything we do, or consequently, don't do, is subject to this law's effects. If this project can educate the public on just how profound and monumental their every action or non-action truly is then the project has succeeded. Those educated shall quickly find themselves more present and in such a state all the more empowered. This is, behind the goal, the projects true purpose.  

Each unique wallet holding "MFLY" is entitled to one post on our DAPP. This post should represent, best they can describe, an experience in one's life that although seemingly insignificant then, turned out to be profound and transformative. Each post shall display it's owners 0x / ENS address and the owner's "flutter" Balance beneath the story. These stories can be upvoted/downvoted on-chain by other holders so as to allow the communities Butterfly Board to carry the communityâ€™s favorite pieces first and foremost atop of the others. 

## Tokenomics

## Authors

This project shall be community ran. The devs are tasked with creating the DAPP, and educating all on the true power of The Butterfly Effect. The community itself shall be publicly and transparently ran by our community, none of which are "owners", all of which are instead passionate.
